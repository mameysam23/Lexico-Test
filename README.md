# Lexico-Test
Ionic Project for Pre-Interview of Lexico

# Task Description
The goal of this mini-project is to create an ionic project to mock data from a json file with two lists which has a parent-children relation ship, display them in a tree and list format and add search and sorting by name features to the lists.

# Approach
The most important part of this project was to map the flat json data into a hierarchical  structure with parent and their children with nested format.

I used Angular Material Tree for the tree Representation of the first list and ion-list for the basic list of the second one.
